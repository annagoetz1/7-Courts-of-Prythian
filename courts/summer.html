<h1> The Summer Court </h1>
<p> The Summer Court is one of the seven Courts of Prythian and one of the four Seasonal Courts. Tarquin is the High Lord of the Summer Court and the youngest of all the High Lords.</p>

<p> The Summer Court is bordered to south by the Spring Court. Its eastern border is the Autumn Court, and the northern border is the Winter Court.
The Summer Court boasts four cities, one of which is the city of Adriata where the High Lord of Summer spends the last weeks of winter and first weeks of spring. A palace is built atop a mountain-island in the heart of a half-moon bay. The city circles the island on three sides and spreads toward the sparkling sea.</p>
